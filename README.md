# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project was created for a homework assignment in the UW Coding Bootcamp. It's purpose was to demonstrate that we could build an app that would past a test package built with Jest.

The app allows you to enter as many members of a team as you'd like with some basic info about them. All roles have a name, id, and email associated with them. The manager role has an office number. The engineer role has a GitHub link. The Intern has a school. Once the information is finished being entered, it populates on a page that looks like the screenshot. NOTE: App is not yet finished.
